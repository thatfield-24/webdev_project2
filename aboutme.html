    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a 19 year old student from Indiana who enjoys running, weight lifting, traveling, and rock climbing. Additionally, I am a current member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.</p>
      <p>I'm studying Business and Information Technology at IIT. My parents have owned multiple restaurants for much of my life which I have worked at since highschool; because of this I found my interest in restaurant consulting. After graduation I hope to pursue a career in restaurant consulting to help small businesses integrate technology and marketing to improve profit.</p>

	<p>After I graduated highschool I spent a week hiking with my friends in the Great Smoky Mountains. When I returned home from Tennessee I also got to fly to Europe and see the Eiffel Tower in person before the Olympics</p>
