      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a 19 year old student from Indiana who enjoys running, weight lifting, traveling, and rock climbing. Additionally, I am a current member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.</p>
      <p>I'm studying Business and Information Technology at IIT. My parents have owned multiple restaurants for much of my life which I have worked at since highschool; because of this I found my interest in restaurant consulting. After graduation I hope to pursue a career in restaurant consulting to help small businesses integrate technology and marketing to improve profit.</p>

				<p>After I graduated highschool I spent a week hiking with my friends in the Great Smoky Mountains. When I returned home from Tennessee I also got to fly to Europe and see the Eiffel Tower in person before the Olympics.</p>

        <p>However even with all the places I have been, I think Yellowstone National Park was one of my favorite locations so far. The entirety of Yellowstone had so many differing environments including snowcapped mountains, geysers, wateerfalls and rivers all within its boundaries.</p>
